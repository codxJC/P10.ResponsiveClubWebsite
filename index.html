            <p>For our meetings we rent the lounge at the local library.
                We meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays 19:00 to 21:00 and on Sundays 17:00 to 19:00.
                </p>
                <p>Weather permitted we organize outdoor fun workouts on Saturdays or social gatherings at local pubs and cafes.</p>

            <h4>Bootcamps</h4>
            <p>Our Bootcamps are intense and fun 45min workouts. The goal is to build strength and stamina. No single bootcamp is the same, we change things all the time to keep the workouts challenging and fun.</p>
            

            <h4>Flexibility & mobility</h4>
            <p>The bootcamp sessions are followed by 45min flexibility workouts.</p>

            <h4>Equipment</h4>
            <p>We provide most of the equipment, though it is recommended to bring your own exercise mat, a towel and a bottle of water or an energy drink to stay hydrated. <br>
            Yoga blocks are helpful for the flexibility section, but optional.</p>
